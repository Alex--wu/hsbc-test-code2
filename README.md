# hsbc-test-code2
##HSBC coding test.
To Run this project:
1. 'npm install';
2. 'npm run test';
3. The test coverage reports are in the /coverage
 
##Key Notes:
* As I said before, I changes single js file to npm + Babel + Karma + Mocha.
* Editorconfig + Eslint + Commit-hook to keep the same coding style for all the developers.
* The coverage reporters support multi browsers.
* Hungarian notation for the variables.
* Open the package.json file to see the full list.
